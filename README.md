# Survival-Game

Just a simple survival game, with different waves and 2 different character bases, made with Unreal Engine 4.14.3. 

Assets from Infinity Blade: Grass Lands + simple Knight Girl package.

To add different waves, go into the Blueprints folder/ KGGameMode and on the left menu, right under Variables you will find Waves. 
Click on it and then, on the right menu, press the plus button, where you will create an array with different types of enemies.
